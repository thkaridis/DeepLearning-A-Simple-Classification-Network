# DeepLearning-A-Simple-Classification-Network

In this assignment you will build a deep classification network, optimised for the dataset CIFAR-101 . 
Your solution must be a simple feedforward network. 
In optimising your network, make sure you address the following aspects:
1. Data pre-processing
2. Depth and width of your network
3. Choice of activation and loss functions
4. Regularisation
5. Choice of learning optimisers
6. Hyper-parameters, such as batch size, epochs, learning rate, etc., depending on the chosen
configuration.
